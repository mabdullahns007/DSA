# Bus Transport System

Welcome to the Bus Transport System project! This project is designed to simulate a real-life bus transport system in Islamabad, focusing on efficient route planning and customer record management. The system covers 12 popular stops and helps users find the shortest and most efficient routes without switching multiple buses.

## Features

- **Efficient Route Calculation**: Given a starting point and a destination, the system calculates the shortest and most efficient route using the available buses.
- **Customer Record Management**: Each customer has a record containing their name, ticket information, trip route, and ticket price.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system is easy to use, allowing users to quickly find routes and manage records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Any C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion, Code::Blocks)

## Usage

Check the GRAPH.PNG image for better understanding of bus routes and stations.

Run final_commented.exe file.

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your starting point and destination. The system will return the shortest route and the most efficient wagons.

To manage customer records, use the provided options to add, view, or delete records.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the system:

- **Input**: Starting point: "Stop A", Destination: "Stop D"
- **Output**: Shortest route: "Stop A -> Stop B -> Stop D", Most efficient wagons: "Wagon 1, Wagon 3"
